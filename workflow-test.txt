This file is created to test the updated sync workflow.
The workflow should detect changes between master and master-jdk21 branches and create a PR automatically.

Testing:
- Proper checkout of master branch
- Diff detection between branches
- PR creation with peter-evans/create-pull-request action
- Proper use of GH_TOKEN secret

Adding this additional text to trigger the workflow again and create more differences between branches.
