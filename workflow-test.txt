Workflow Test File
===================

This is a test file to verify the complete sync workflow cycle:

1. Create dummy commit ✓
2. Merge to master → triggers sync workflow
3. Sync PR created (master → master-jdk21)
4. Merge sync PR to master-jdk21
5. Revert commit from master → should trigger sync with revert
6. Verify revert is synced to master-jdk21

Test timestamp: 2025-07-18
Test commit ID: Will be updated with actual commit hash
Purpose: Testing enhanced sync workflow with revert detection

Expected behavior:
- Sync workflow should detect this non-jenkins commit
- Author should be mentioned in sync PR
- Revert commit should be properly flagged with ⚠️ indicator
- Revert should sync to master-jdk21 branch
