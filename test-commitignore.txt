Testing Commit Ignore Functionality
===================================

This file is created to test the commit ignore functionality.

Steps:
1. Create this commit and push to master
2. Wait for sync PR to be created (master â†’ master-jdk21)
3. Add this commit SHA to .github/.commitignore
4. Push the .commitignore update
5. Verify this commit is excluded from the sync PR

Expected behavior:
- Initially, this commit should appear in the sync PR
- After adding to .commitignore, it should be excluded
- The sync PR should update to remove this commit from the sync

Test timestamp: 2025-07-18
Purpose: Verify commit ignore functionality works correctly
