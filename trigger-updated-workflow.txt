This file is created to trigger the updated workflow with improved debugging and permissions.
The workflow should now:
1. Explicitly set permissions for GITHUB_TOKEN
2. Show detailed debugging information
3. Better handle cases where master-jdk21 doesn't exist
4. Create a PR with information about the changes included
