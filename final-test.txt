Final Test of Simplified Sync Workflow
======================================

This file tests the complete sync workflow after removing all commit ignore functionality.

Test objectives:
1. Verify workflow triggers on master push
2. Confirm sync PR is created/updated (master → master-jdk21)
3. Check author collection works correctly
4. Verify PR comments include author mentions
5. Confirm revert detection still works
6. Test jenkins file filtering still works

Expected behavior:
- Sync workflow should run successfully
- Non-jenkins commits should be detected
- Author should be mentioned in PR comments
- Revert commits should be flagged with ⚠️
- Jenkins-only commits should be filtered out
